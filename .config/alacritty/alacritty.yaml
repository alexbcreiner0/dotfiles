# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of

  offset:

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
